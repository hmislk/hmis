The use will click the Issue button, so that an issue bill is created. The quantities to be issued are calculated after checking previous issues and issue cancellation.

This works fine for AMPs where all are in units. But failes when AMPPs are used. At the time of generating the number remainig to issue , its treated as in units.

What should have done is that calculations has to be done by AMPs as there are not AMPP stocks, An while keeping the Pharmaceutical Bill Item with quantities in units, the bill item and bill item finance details should record it in units. If there are not full pack size in the remaining qty in selected stocks, it needs to be skipped.
Please fix it
