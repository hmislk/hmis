this is where we good receive
http://localhost:8080/rh/faces/pharmacy/pharmacy_grn_costing_with_save_approve.xhtml

this is the list where we select GRNs to return

http://localhost:8080/rh/faces/pharmacy/pharmacy_grn_list_for_return.xhtml

this is where we return goods
http://localhost:8080/rh/faces/pharmacy/grn_return_with_costing.xhtml
the user may return only one item. leaving any others withour returning.
So the return quantity is zero in some bill items

in the printing. those items with 0 return quantities also printed

we need to save only the bill items with a non zero return qty. if there are items with zero, we have to retired them if already saved. if not already saved, we can simply remove it from the bill item list.
