## Guidelines

### Message Structure
- **Start with checkmark** ✅ to indicate completion
- **Use emojis** for visual organization (🎯, 📍, 📚, 🔗)
- **Keep bullet points** concise and user-focused
- **Include clear navigation** path for accessing the feature
- **Provide both user and technical** references

### Content Tips
- **Focus on user benefits** rather than technical implementation
- **Use simple language** that non-technical staff can understand
- **Include item types** relevant to the specific feature (medicines/store items/lab items)
- **Mention export capabilities** when available
- **Reference all procurement types** for comprehensive coverage

### Link Format
- **Wiki links** should use the actual GitHub wiki URL format
- **Issue links** should reference the original GitHub issue number
- **PR links** should reference the implementation pull request

### Audience Considerations
- **Hospital administrators** need to understand business value
- **End users** need clear access instructions
- **IT teams** need technical reference links
- **Training coordinators** need user guide references

## When to Use

## Distribution
