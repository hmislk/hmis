### 4. Lean Healthcare Principles

#### Eight Wastes in Healthcare
1. **Defects**: Medical errors, rework, incorrect treatments
2. **Overproduction**: Unnecessary tests, excessive documentation
3. **Waiting**: Patient wait times, staff idle time
4. **Non-utilized Talent**: Underutilizing staff skills and knowledge
5. **Transportation**: Moving patients, supplies, information
6. **Inventory**: Excess supplies, medications, equipment
7. **Motion**: Unnecessary staff movement, inefficient layouts
8. **Extra Processing**: Redundant approvals, excessive documentation

#### Lean Tools for Healthcare
- **5S Methodology**: Sort, Set in order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain
- **Standard Work**: Consistent processes and procedures
- **Poka-Yoke**: Error-proofing mechanisms
- **Kaizen**: Continuous improvement culture
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 5 Whys and fishbone diagrams

### 5. Future State Design

#### Design Principles
- **Patient-Centered**: Optimize for patient experience and outcomes
- **Evidence-Based**: Use data and best practices to guide decisions
- **Technology-Enabled**: Leverage HMIS capabilities for automation
- **Staff-Friendly**: Design for ease of use and efficiency

#### Workflow Integration with HMIS
- **Single Sign-On**: Reduce login burden across applications
- **Context Switching**: Minimize screen changes and data re-entry
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Timely notifications for critical events
- **Mobile Access**: Enable workflow continuation across devices

#### Change Management Considerations
- **Stakeholder Buy-in**: Involve staff in design process
- **Training Requirements**: Plan for new workflow education
- **Pilot Testing**: Start with small-scale implementations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measure improvement outcomes
