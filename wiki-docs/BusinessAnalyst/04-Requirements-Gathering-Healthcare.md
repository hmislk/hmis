# Requirements Gathering in Healthcare Settings

## Session Overview
**Duration**: 2 hours
**Prerequisites**: Sessions 1-3 completion
**Session Type**: Practical Skills

## Learning Objectives
- Master healthcare-specific requirement elicitation techniques
- Handle clinical user interviews effectively
- Document functional requirements with healthcare compliance considerations
- Manage competing priorities between clinical, administrative, and technical stakeholders

## Key Topics

### 1. Healthcare Stakeholder Characteristics

#### Clinical Staff Challenges
- **Time Constraints**: Limited availability due to patient care responsibilities
- **Technical Literacy**: Varying comfort levels with technology
- **Workflow Disruption**: Resistance to changes that impact patient care
- **Clinical Priorities**: Patient safety always comes first

#### Administrative Staff Considerations
- **Regulatory Focus**: Compliance and reporting requirements
- **Financial Impact**: Cost-benefit analysis and ROI concerns
- **Operational Efficiency**: Process optimization and resource utilization
- **Risk Management**: Legal and liability considerations

### 2. Specialized Elicitation Techniques

#### Shadow and Observe
- **Clinical Shadowing**: Observe actual patient care workflows
- **Workflow Documentation**: Map current state processes
- **Pain Point Identification**: Identify inefficiencies and frustrations
- **Best Practice Discovery**: Understand workarounds and innovations

#### Structured Interviews
- **Role-Specific Questions**: Tailor questions to clinical specialties
- **Scenario-Based Discussions**: Use patient cases to elicit requirements
- **Exception Handling**: Focus on edge cases and emergency procedures
- **Integration Needs**: Understand downstream impacts

#### Group Sessions
- **Multidisciplinary Rounds**: Participate in clinical team meetings
- **Quality Improvement Sessions**: Join existing improvement initiatives
- **Training Observations**: Observe new staff orientation
- **Committee Participation**: Attend relevant medical staff committees

### 3. Healthcare-Specific Requirement Categories

#### Functional Requirements
- **Clinical Workflows**: Step-by-step process documentation
- **Data Capture**: What information must be collected and when
- **Decision Support**: Clinical alerts, reminders, and guidelines
- **Reporting**: Clinical, administrative, and regulatory reports

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Response time critical for clinical decisions
- **Security**: HIPAA compliance and data protection
- **Reliability**: System availability during patient care
- **Usability**: Minimize clicks and cognitive load

#### Regulatory Requirements
- **Meaningful Use**: EHR certification requirements
- **Quality Measures**: Core measures and patient safety indicators
- **Privacy Controls**: Access controls and audit logging
- **Retention Policies**: Legal record-keeping requirements

### 4. Documentation Strategies

#### User Stories for Healthcare
```
As a [clinical role],
I want [functionality]
So that [patient care benefit/clinical outcome]
```

#### Acceptance Criteria with Clinical Context
- Include patient safety considerations
- Specify error handling for critical situations
- Define clinical validation requirements
- Address workflow integration points

#### Regulatory Compliance Notes
- Map requirements to specific regulations
- Document audit trail needs
- Specify access control requirements
- Note data retention and disposal rules

### 5. Managing Competing Priorities

#### Clinical vs. Administrative Priorities
- **Clinical Focus**: Patient care efficiency and safety
- **Administrative Focus**: Cost reduction and compliance
- **Resolution Strategy**: Find solutions that benefit both areas

#### Immediate vs. Long-term Needs
- **Immediate**: Quick wins and critical fixes
- **Long-term**: Strategic initiatives and major improvements
- **Balancing Act**: Phase implementations to show early value

#### Resource Constraints
- **Budget Limitations**: Prioritize high-impact, low-cost improvements
- **Time Constraints**: Focus on essential features first
- **Technical Constraints**: Work within existing infrastructure

## Practical Exercises
1. **Interview Simulation**: Practice interviewing different healthcare roles
2. **Requirement Prioritization**: Use MoSCoW method for healthcare scenarios
3. **User Story Writing**: Create healthcare-specific user stories
4. **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify all affected parties for an HMIS change

## Common Interview Questions by Role

### For Physicians
- "Walk me through your typical patient encounter"
- "What information do you need before seeing a patient?"
- "What slows you down in your documentation?"
- "How do you stay updated on patient status changes?"

### For Nurses
- "Describe your shift handoff process"
- "What patient information is critical at the bedside?"
- "How do you coordinate with other departments?"
- "What safety checks are most important to you?"

### For Administrators
- "What reports do you need for operations management?"
- "How do you measure department performance?"
- "What regulatory reports are required?"
- "What are your biggest operational challenges?"

## Key Takeaways
- Healthcare requirements gathering requires deep understanding of clinical workflows
- Multiple stakeholder perspectives must be balanced carefully
- Patient safety considerations must be embedded in all requirements
- Regulatory compliance is non-negotiable and must be built into every feature

## Requirements Documentation Template
- **Requirement ID**: Unique identifier
- **Description**: Detailed functional description
- **Clinical Rationale**: Why this requirement supports patient care
- **Regulatory Basis**: Applicable regulations or standards
- **Priority**: MoSCoW classification with clinical justification
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable conditions including clinical validation
- **Dependencies**: Related requirements and system components

## Next Session Preview
Session 5 will explore data analysis and healthcare analytics, including understanding different types of healthcare data and creating meaningful reports for various stakeholders.
