#### Healthcare User Stories
```
As a [clinical role],
I want [functionality]
So that [patient care benefit/safety improvement]

Example:
As an Emergency Department physician,
I want real-time allergy alerts when ordering medications
So that I can prevent allergic reactions and improve patient safety
```
