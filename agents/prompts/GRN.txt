in Stock Quantity Adjustment, the  id="printSection" section is rendered
it has  id="adjustmentBill"  where the receipt (bill) can be printed. 
We must have different receipt formats for each of the above bill types
Can you please make sure after adjustments, the receipts are generated by making the printPreview = true. Under print section,  if no receipts, have to create receipt composite components and call them to the page
