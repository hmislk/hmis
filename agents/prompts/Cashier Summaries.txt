When a Pharmacy Pre Bills is raised, stock transactions happen. But payments are NOT yet accepted.

These bills with the status of payment are listed in these pages

http://localhost:8080/rh/faces/pharmacy/pharmacy_search_sale_pre_bill.xhtml - To Search Such Bills. It lists the related Payment Bills when present. This is listing as expected

This is the page such bills are listed to make a payment
http://localhost:8080/rh/faces/pharmacy/pharmacy_search_pre_bill.xhtml

the Search Token Bills , Search Not Paid Tokens buttons are not listing as expected since last few updates.



in http://localhost:8080/rh/faces/reports/cashier_reports/cashier_summary.xhtml, the "Pharmacy Collection" (id="panelPharmacyCollection") correctly considers the bills with BillTypeAtomic having PHARMACY_RETAIL_SALE_PREBILL_SETTLED_AT_CASHIER when the payment Method is Cash

but when the payment method is Credit or Staff Credit, such bills should be listed under the id="panelPharmacyCreditBills". This is not happening. Must be an issue of missing bill type atomic there in #{searchController.generateCashierSummary} method

Please fix it
