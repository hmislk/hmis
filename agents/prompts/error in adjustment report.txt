1234 is after adjustment in first row
5678 is after adjustment in second row
but in



under the page pharmacy_adjustment_index
there are different types of adjustments
each have a separate page.
each page has a print preview section where printPreview = true
in each print preview section, has a unique composite component to print the receipt
the buttons include 
id="btnNavigateToStockAdjustment"
id="btnNavigateToStaffStockAdjustment"
id="btnNavigateToPurchaseRateAdjustment"
id="btnNavigateToCostRateAdjustment"
id="btnNavigateToRetailRateAdjustment"
id="btnNavigateToWholesaleAdjustment"
id="btnNavigateToExpiaryAdjustment"

for each button there is a seperate the BillTypeAtomic and composite component used for printing

Each have to have a reprint page for all above pages with the same composite components

in the same way, we have to have a print page and a composite component for the bill type atomic PHARMACY_STOCK_ADJUSTMENT_BILL as well
it should be called in action="#{billSearch.navigateToViewBillByAtomicBillTypeByBillId(pi.bill.id)}"
