In
src/main/java/com/divudi/bean/pharmacy/DirectPurchaseReturnWorkflowController.java
around lines 336 to 348, the current logic skips Cash and swallows payment
creation failures allowing approval to proceed; change it so payment creation is
attempted for all payment methods including PaymentMethod.Cash, and treat any
failure as blocking by stopping the approval flow: attempt to create the
payment, log the error and add an error message, then prevent further processing
by rethrowing the exception or returning a failure result (do not just log and
continue). Ensure the condition that gates payment creation includes Cash and
that on success you add the success message as before.
