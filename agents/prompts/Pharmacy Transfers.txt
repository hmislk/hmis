What should be corrected in Pacs - Pacs will be AMPP in billItem.item

Stock should be displayed as 100.0 (1 pack x 100 ) - use billItem.billItemFinanceDetails.unitsPerPack, but sorting should be based on qty by units. ie 100

Retails Sale value should be corrected by getting data from getting qty and prices from billItem.pharmaceuticalBillItem
Same correction is required for Purchase Values and Cost value
