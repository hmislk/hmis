What should be corrected in packs — packs are AMPP in billItem.item

Stock should be displayed as 100.0 (1 pack × 100). Use billItem.billItemFinanceDetails.unitsPerPack, but sorting should be based on quantity by units (i.e., 100).

Retail Sale value should be corrected by getting quantity and prices from billItem.pharmaceuticalBillItem.
Apply the same correction for Purchase Value and Cost Value.
