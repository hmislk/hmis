Need to convert an Entity Based method to a DTO based method
First Refer to the documents in the folder \developer_docs\dto

UI is from the page \src\main\webapp\resources\pharmacy\history.xhtml - component id="tblDirectPurchase" 
Identify the details needed to be listed in that table

Relevant Controller - PharmacyController
Relevant Method - createPoTable()
	This is based in Entity
	Need to convert to a DTO Based one
	Keep this old method and deprecate it with a comment to the correct method

Proposed New Method Name createPoTableDto()

In public void fillDetails() { method, insert new DTO Method, and comment out old method

This conversion is already completed for id="tblDirectPurchase" in history.xhtml
The old method createDirectPurchaseTable
The new method createDirectPurchaseTableDto
