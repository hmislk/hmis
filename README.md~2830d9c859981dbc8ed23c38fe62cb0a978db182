# Open Hospital Management Information System

## Title

Open Source Hospital Management Information System

## Description

Introducing our Hospital Information Management System, a trusted solution that has been actively serving over 40 healthcare institutions since its inception in 2004. This comprehensive system offers a suite of modules tailored to support the multifaceted workflows of contemporary hospitals. Its adaptability ensures that variances in institutional requirements are easily addressed through configuration.

From the outset, the system has consistently prioritised user-friendliness and operational speed over ornate user interfaces. In 2015, a significant evolution took place with the introduction of a multi-site architecture, further enhancing its reliability and scalability.

A cornerstone of this system is its Object-Oriented Design, which strikes a balance between simplicity and robustness. This design approach ensures flexibility, making it adept at navigating the intricate and varied business workflows inherent to the healthcare sector.

The system's architecture leans heavily on Object-Oriented Principles, consistently aligning with tried-and-true data models, such as the dm+d of NHS, UK. This alignment guarantees a design that's not only robust and optimised but also primed for seamless integration of future extensions to meet emerging needs.

Developed using Java Enterprise Edition, the system offers both a web application and a RESTful server. While the choice of database management system rests with the implementing team, MySQL or MariaDB comes highly recommended. Complementing JavaEE are technologies like JSF, JPA, and PrimeFaces. The lab middleware is crafted in C#, and standalone applications, which leverage RESTful services, are built using JavaSE.

## History

In 2004, Dr. M H B Ariyaratne, a medical doctor, pioneered the development of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) System tailored for his general practice. Utilising Microsoft Visual Basic 6 and MS-Access, this system caught the attention of fellow doctors, leading to widespread adoption. As its user base grew, so did its features, evolving through collaborative discussions and feedback.

Recognising the diverse needs of its users, which included clinical laboratories, medical channelling centres, and hospitals, the system expanded with additional modules to cater to these requirements.

By 2012, a shift was made towards a more robust platform. A new JavaEE-based system was launched as an Open Source Initiative, hosted on GitHub under the MIT license. This project was fortunate to receive the dedicated support of students from the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technical Education in Labuduwa, Galle. As part of their Higher National Diploma in Information Technology (HNDIT) programme, these students contributed under Mr. K.M.G.T.R. Waidyarathne, a Department Of Information Technology lecturer. Post-graduation, several students remained involved, continuing their support with financial backing from Dr. M H B Ariyaratne.

Commercial support was introduced to enhance the system's reach and reliability, offering services such as installations, user training, maintenance, cloud hosting, and troubleshooting.
