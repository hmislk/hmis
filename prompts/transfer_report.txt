I want to add a new report under the page - stock_transfer_report
http://localhost:8080/rh/faces/reports/inventoryReports/stock_transfer_report.xhtml

A new report Type should be there - Breakdown Summary
So new addition is required for id="reportType"

Second Level - toDepartment -sum of qty in  pharmaceuticalBillItems where from Department from level 1 + to department in level 2
