When we click the Create Return button, we go to the page http://124.43.4.189:8010/rhLocal/faces/pharmacy/pharmacy_grn_return_form.xhtml
During the navigation, depending on the preference, the total qty to be return and the Return rate (Total Cost Rate) are correctly filled.
Once return rate is generated like that, the user may change it. We must not change it pro grammatically afterwords at any point. But is is changed at few places.
for example, 
once we click the save button, the rates is always converted to purchase rate, ignoring the configuration

can you please fix it

then we can click the save button any number of times
Once we click the Finalize button, the order is finalized

the orders waiting to be approves after finalizing are listed in
